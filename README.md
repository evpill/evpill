👋 Hi, I’m @evpill
- [x] 👀 I’m interested in ... lot's of things.
- [x] 🌱 I’m currently learning ... lot's of things.
- [x] 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... lot's of things.
- [ ] 📫 How to reach me ... I'm not quite ready for that in this point of our relationship.

<sup> Disclaimer: If it wasn't obvious, I only slightly modified the default README.md... just so that the prompt would go away and so that I could feel like I wasn't ignoring it nor missing out on something. </sup>
